### week 10 
- Learn what modules are and how to use them to divide better and organize code.
### week 11
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
### Week 12
Practice with the 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.
### Week 13
- Learn how functions can accept infinite parameters, and how to make custom functions do the same.
- Understand what decorators are and how to use them to write cleaner code.
- Practice with decorator exercises.
### Week 14
- Data structure progress.
- Introduction to data structures and how to create the most popular ones (like stacks, queues, linked lists).
- Hands-on project: Creating a Queue in Python.
### Week 15
- Learn what sorting algorithms are and how to build the simplest one: Bubble Sort.
- Understand why we need to analyze our algorithms and how to use Big O notation.
- Practice exercises on algorithm analysis and implementation.
 - Exercises to reinforce the data structure concepts learned
### Week 16
- Package Managers: Learn what package managers are, what they’re used for, and which one is the default for Python.
- Unit Testing: Understand what testing is and why unit testing is the most popular and widely used way to test our code.
- Unit Testing Exercises: Practice unit testing to reinforce the concepts covered in the lesson.
### Week 17
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUI): Learn how GUIs traditionally work and how to create them in Python using one of the best external libraries.
 Personal Finance Manager Project: Hands-on project where a personal finance system is developed using GUI concepts.
###  Week 18
- General Interview Tips: These are general tips you can (and should) apply in all your conversational interviews. Beyond that, they are communication tips you can use to improve your daily interactions.
- Mock Interview 1 (1:1 Session): Practice interview to simulate real scenarios and receive feedback.
-
