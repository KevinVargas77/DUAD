ONCE

I admit it
What's to say
I'll relive it
Without pain
Backstreet lover on the side of the road
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a 16-gauge buried under my clothes, I pray
Once upon a time
I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time
I could lose myself, yeah
Oh, try and mimic
What's insane
I am in it
Where do I stand?
Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet
I pray
Once upon a time
I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time
I could lose myself, yeah
You think I got my eyes closed
But I'm looking at you the whole fucking time
Once upon a time
I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time
I could lose myself, yeah
Ooh, once upon a time
I could love myself, yeah
Once upon a time
I could love you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Once
Once
Once
Once
Yeah, once, once, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
